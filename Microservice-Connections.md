     - Product Catalog Service at `productcatalogservice:3550`
     - Shipping Service at `shippingservice:50051`
     - Payment Service at `paymentservice:50051`
     - Email Service at `emailservice:5000`
     - Currency Service at `currencyservice:7000`
     - Cart Service at `cartservice:7070`

3. **Recommendation Service:**

   - Connects to: Product Catalog Service at `productcatalogservice:3550`

4. **Frontend:**
   - Deployment Name: `frontend`
   - Service Name: `frontend`
   - Container Port: 8080
   - Exposed Ports:
     - 80 (NodePort)
     - 80 (LoadBalancer)
   - Connects to:
     - Product Catalog Service at `productcatalogservice:3550`
     - Currency Service at `currencyservice:7000`
     - Cart Service at `cartservice:7070`
     - Recommendation Service at `recommendationservice:8080`
     - Shipping Service at `shippingservice:50051`
     - Checkout Service at `checkoutservice:5050`
     - Ad Service at `adservice:9555`

5. **Payment Service:**
   - Deployment Name: `paymentservice`
   - Service Name: `paymentservice`
   - Container Port: 50051
   - Exposed Port: 50051
   - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but likely used by other services

6. **Product Catalog Service:**
   - Deployment Name: `productcatalogservice`
   - Service Name: `productcatalogservice`
   - Container Port: 3550
   - Exposed Port: 3550
   - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but likely used by other services

7. **Cart Service:**
   - Deployment Name: `cartservice`
   - Service Name: `cartservice`
   - Container Port: 7070
   - Exposed Port: 7070
   - Connects to: Redis at `redis-cart:6379`

8. **Load Generator:**
   - Deployment Name: `loadgenerator`
   - Connects to: Frontend at `frontend:80`

9. **Currency Service:**
   - Deployment Name: `currencyservice`
   - Service Name: `currencyservice`
   - Container Port: 7000
   - Exposed Port: 7000
   - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but likely used by other services

10. **Shipping Service:**
    - Deployment Name: `shippingservice`
    - Service Name: `shippingservice`
    - Container Port: 50051
    - Exposed Port: 50051
    - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but likely used by other services

11. **Redis for Cart Service:**
    - Deployment Name: `redis-cart`
    - Service Name: `redis-cart`
    - Container Port: 6379
    - Exposed Port: 6379
    - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but used by Cart Service

12. **Ad Service:**
    - Deployment Name: `adservice`
    - Service Name: `adservice`
    - Container Port: 9555
    - Exposed Port: None
    - Connects to: None mentioned in this YAML, but likely used by other services

In summary, these microservices are interconnected through their respective services, and the Frontend service acts as the entry point for external communication. The connections between services are established using Kubernetes services and the specified ports. Additionally, some services, like Cart Service, use external services like Redis for data storage.
